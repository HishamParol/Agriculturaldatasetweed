# SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION OF AERIAL FARMLAND IMAGES USING DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE

# Abstract 

The application of technology in farming has expanded dramatically over the past few years. Here aerial images are captured by the agricultural drones and these
pictures are fed to advanced convolutional neural networks to analyse the agricultural patterns. As a pilot study of aerial agricultural pattern classification,
various deep learning-based segmentation models are studied and implemented. This project selected
three popular models to fit agricultural data and results are evaluated.This technology will enable us to take full advantage of this technology in monitoring the real-time farmlands and identifying patterns to quickly respond and take action. Doing this can reduce the usage of herbicides in farmlands
thus reducing labour costs and environmental impacts.

# How to setup and run the project

Semantic segmentation model of agricultural farmland images are build using Python's Django framework. This function will run on multiple Operating Systems including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

See installation for full installation instructions. You will need a modern GPU with CUDA support for best performance. AMD GPUs are partially supported.

This project has two entry points:
1- Train a model from scratch and see the evaluation metrics. 

2- Predict a new test image and see the results.
